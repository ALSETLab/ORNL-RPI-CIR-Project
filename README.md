# ORNL-RPI-CIR-Project
This project is currently a prototype for a continuous integration and regression testing workflow tool.
For now, there is only the CI workflow, which is triggered manually in the actions tab. ONce triggered Openmodelica is installed and runs a python script simulating the bouncing ball example. The result is then stored as a .mat file and added to the repository.
